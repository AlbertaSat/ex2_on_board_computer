Reliance Edge Contribution Guidelines
=====================================

This document describes how to go about contributing to Reliance Edge.

How Can I Contribute?
---------------------

A few examples of how you can contribute:

- Fixing bugs, including: compiler warnings, portability issues, or erroneous
  driver logic.
- Porting Reliance Edge to a new RTOS.
- Improving the documentation, including: fixing typos, dead links, or poor
  wording; or pointing out unclear or incomplete instructions.
- Creating new tools or tests.
- Adding new features or APIs (though for major new features, it might be good
  to discuss your idea with Datalight).

Suggestions and feedback of any kind are welcome at
<RelianceEdgeSupport@datalight.com>.  If there is something about Reliance Edge
which you like or do not like, let us know.

Reporting Bugs
--------------

To report bugs, please create a GitHub issue or contact
<RelianceEdgeSupport@datalight.com>.  Search the existing GitHub issues to make
sure that your issue is not a known issue.

Submitting Changes
------------------

To submit code changes, fork the Reliance Edge repository, commit your changes,
and use GitHub to submit a pull request.  See details here:

<https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/>

After submitting a pull request, it will be reviewed by Datalight engineers.
You may be asked to make changes via the comments on the pull request.  If the
pull request contributes a substantial amount of code, you will need to assign
copyright to Datalight before it will be accepted (see the next section).

Pull requests often will not be directly merged into the Reliance Edge GitHub
repo.  Due to quality assurance and packaging requirements, pull requests which
are accepted will be incorporated indirectly and pushed into the GitHub
repository as part of a build.  In some cases, the pull request may also be
merged directly on GitHub, but often the pull request will be closed with a
comment to indicate whether the changes were incorporated or not.

For the portions of the _Developer's Guide_ that are included in the GitHub
repository (like the API documentation, which is derived from Doxygen comments
in the code), changes should be submitted as pull requests just like code.  For
the prose chapters which are excluded from the repository, send an email to
<RelianceEdgeSupport@datalight.com> to request changes.

Copyright
---------

Datalight policy is that Datalight must own the copyright of all code
incorporated into Reliance Edge; if contributing a substantial amount of code,
you must file a copyright assignment agreement.  After submitting your pull
request, contact <RelianceEdgeSupport@datalight.com> if you believe you will
need to assign the copyright.  If Datalight determines that a copyright
assignment agreement is required, and you have not made contact, you will be
notified via a comment left on the pull request.

CREDITS.TXT
-----------

CREDITS.TXT is a list of people who have made non-trivial contributions to
Reliance Edge.  If you contribute to Reliance Edge, it is understood that
Datalight may, at our discretion, add your name and GitHub account name to
CREDITS.TXT, unless you explicitly request to be excluded.

Datalight Coding Style
----------------------

Code contributed to Reliance Edge should make an attempt to follow Datalight
coding style.  See the doc/coding_style.txt document.
