Contains code that tests using two way communication over CAN (without using interrupts) on two TMS570LC43x microcontrollers

The DCAN1 folder contains code that will transmit a message to the second microcontroller and await for a response. DCAN2 contains code for the second microcontroller that will receive the data, modify it, and send a modified version of the data back to the first microcontroller

The DCAN2 code should be started first, as it will sit in a while loop waiting for a message to arrive. The DCAN1 code should be started after the DCAN2 code.

For unknown reasons, the code doesnâ€™t appear to work when both microcontrollers are plugged into my laptop, but has worked when each one is plugged into a seperate computer
